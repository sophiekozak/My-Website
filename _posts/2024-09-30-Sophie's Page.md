My name is Sophie Kozak. I am currently a senior at UConn studying physics and astrophysics. I am currently in Prof. Jonathan Trump's research group studying supermassive black holes at cosmic dawn. Black holes were once seen as just a mathematical concept, but we now know they exist at the center of every galaxy. Professor Trumpâ€™s research group is focused on understanding how these supermassive black holes form and grow. We use data from various sources, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and soon, the Rubin Observatory. At UConn, our research team studies the environments around black holes, measuring their mass, spin, and how they pull in matter. We also explore the relationship between black holes and their galaxies, particularly how the first black holes formed in the early universe.
