My name is Sophie Kozak. I am currently a Physics major and Astrophysics minor at UConn. I am currently employed at Innovate Labs at UConn. Innovate Labs is an emerging technology lab and maker space on campus dedicated to teaching students about valuable skills that may not be taught in the classroom but used in industry.
