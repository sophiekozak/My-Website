Outside of my academic pursuits, I work at UConn's Innovate Labs, an emerging technology lab, educational research center, and makerspace on campus. We offer students from all disciplines access to resources and technologies that arenâ€™t typically covered in the classroom but are essential in the industry. Our mission at Innovate Labs is to create experiential learning opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds, helping them develop unique skill sets that will nurture the next generation of learners, leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators. In my role on the outreach team, I facilitate events at the lab to showcase our offerings as a makerspace and ensure students can fully utilize the resources available to them.
