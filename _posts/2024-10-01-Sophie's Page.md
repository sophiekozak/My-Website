Outside of my academic pursuits, I work at UConn's Innovate Labs, an emerging technology lab, educational research center, and makerspace on campus. We offer students from all majors access to resources and technology that arenâ€™t typically used in the classroom but are essential in the industry and careers. Our mission at Innovate Labs is to create experiential learning opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds, helping them develop unique skill sets that will nurture the next generation of learners, leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators. In my role on outreach team, I organize and facilitate events at the lab to show off our technology and help students utilize our resources.
